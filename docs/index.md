## Overview

Brawlcord is a Discord bot, an intance of [Red](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot), which allows users to play a simplified version of the game [Brawl Stars](https://brawlstars.com) (developed by Supercell) on Discord.  

> Fast-paced multiplayer battles from the makers of Clash of Clans, Clash Royale and Boom Beach.

Battle with friends or solo across a variety of game modes in under three minutes. Unlock and upgrade dozens of Brawlers with powerful super abilities. Purchase and collect unique skins to stand out and show off in the arena. Join or start a band to share tactics and fight together.

## How To Use

You can use the bot in the [Brawlcord Community Server](https://discord.gg/7zJ3PbJ) or invite it to your own server using [this link](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=644118957917208576&scope=bot&permissions=321600&scope=bot).  

**Note:** By using the link above, Brawlcord will be able to read messages, send messages, manage messages, embed links, attach files, add reactions, and use external emojis wherever allowed. You can remove the permissions manually, but that may break the bot.
