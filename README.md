# Overview

Rush Wars Cog is a [Red bot](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot) cog to play a simplified version of the game [Rush Wars](https://rushwarsgame.com) (developed by Supercell) on Discord.  

> Ready to kick butt and get mega rich? From the creators of Clash of Clans and Clash Royale comes a heroic combat strategy game full of surprises like a laser firin’ robot dinosaur and exploding arcade machines!

Rush Wars has everything you love in a strategy game and more: exciting and unexpected new characters, outsmarting the opposition, and competitive team battles. Rush Wars is a casual game for everyone to enjoy but provides the depth and challenge competitive players desire as they rise through the ranks. No hours wasted on designing and changing defensive bases, no long wait times to prepare your troops for battle. So start building your butt kickin’ squad and Rush into battle today!

The game is currently in BETA and available in the following countries (on both iOS and Android):  

- Canada
- Finland
- New Zealand
- Australia

**Edit:** Unfortunately, [Supercell has decided not to continue the Rush Wars beta](https://supercell.com/en/news/rush-wars-closing/7225/).

## Features

The cog replicates the real game in a number of ways while adapting to the text-based form of Discord. It has the following features:

- Battle against players (random or specified) for glory (and rewards)  
- Construct your ultimate attack squad to raid enemy gold mines and get mega rich
- Set up defense to protect your riches  
- See your stats and show off to friends  
- And of course, KICK BUTT & GET MEGA RICH!!

## Installation

First make sure you have Red Bot V3 installed. Instructions to install Red Bot can be found [here](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot#installation).

Next add my repo using the following command:

> Note: [p] will be your prefix in all of the following commands.  

`[p]repo add rushcog https://github.com/snowsee/rushwars-cog`

Then, you will have to install cog by using the following command:

`[p]cog install rushcog rushwars`

You should see the following message after the installation:
> Thank you for trying out the Rush Wars cog, based on the game developed by Supercell.

Load the cog once you see that message using the following command:
`[p]load rushwars`

Make sure that you use the `[p]cog update` command to periodically update your cogs. This will ensure that you are getting the latest bug fixes and features. You may also update a specific cog by using `[p]cog update rushwars`.

**Important Note**: The cog uses external Rush Wars emotes. They are stored in the following two Discord servers:

- [Rush Bot](https://discord.gg/gAxKGac)
- [Rush Bot Emotes](https://discord.gg/8euG6v8)

Unfortunately, due to Discord limitations, you can't add your bot to these servers directly. In order to have your bot added to the abovementioned servers, you must send me a direct message with your bot's OAuth invite link. While I know this isn't ideal, this is currently the only working way. I'll work on adding an option to disable emotes in the future.

- [X] Commanders
